1.  MULTIPLE JSON:-(Resolved)
	For the Generation of the Service and Controller layer files we are using the json file to fill the templates
	and as of now we are creating the multiple json from the pojos class so the total number of json file is equal
	to the number of pojos classes.

	Solution:
		we have to reduce the json file to one so we can use the only one json to fill the multiple templates or we should use YAML.

2.Patch Operations:-
	For the Patch operation we are using two queries, so can user hit the patch operation we will hit the database
	two times which is costly operation.

	Solution:- For the patch operation in MYSQL we have to use two Queries as MySql does'nt provide the Returning clause in the
	            Update method like in PostgreSQL or Oracle.
	            Link of issue in JOOQ:- https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/6865
	            PostgreSQL Update Sql Command: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-update.html

		
3. Our current version is only supporting the batch insertion operation.
	 
4. Multiple schema is not supported in this version.

5. There should be no same table name in different multiple schema.

6. Script Should not have Multiple AutoIncrement statment (JOOQ throws parsing error).

7. Composite primary key. (i.e CRUD operation from single primary key is not allowed in case of composite primary keys).

8. Mapping annotations between two tables as of now JOOQ is not able to put the mapping annotations on the generated POJOS(i.e @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToMany).

9. Issues raise to JOOQ team (Github).
	https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/14012 (For returning void in insert() and update()).
